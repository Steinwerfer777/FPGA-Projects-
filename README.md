# FPGA-Projects-
This contains all of my FPGA projects using Intel Quartus Prime IDE with microprocessor hardware during University including test benches. 
Currently Labs 1, 3 -> 7. 
6 is currently incomplete however some of the counters and SSD used in previous projects were also used in 6. 

Objectives:

1: Introduction to VHDL & the microprocessor unit
3: Using JK Flip Flops to implement a counter 
4: Using '0' logic to display components for a Hexidecimal display
5: Using a Universal Shift Register & the microprocessor's LEDs to perform a "Night Rider" style light variant
6: Constructing a 24-hr digital clock which used several of the previously designed components including SSDs, Hexidecimal Decoders, & counters 
7: Testing logic maps for static hazard and then correcting those errors. These used two seperate NAND gates to implement, the correcting variant involved a 10 ns delay
